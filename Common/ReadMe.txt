Write a function in Kotlin called getCommonElements that takes two lists of integers as parameters and returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both input lists, without any duplicates. 
The order of the elements in the output list doesn't matter.

For example, if the two input lists are [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6], the function should return [3, 4].
